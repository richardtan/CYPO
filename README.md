#C.Y.P.O - Check your phone often

C.Y.P.O is a project initially created to see what I could do with Android Wear when I got my Android Wear Device.

This application basically tells you how often you turn your phone or wear device on per day.

You can download the app on the Google Play Store via the below link.
