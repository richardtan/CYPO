        C.Y.P.O (Check your phone often) is an app that will keep track of the number of times you
        turn on your phone, tablet or watch. Just leave it running in the background and you will
        get daily notification of how often you turn your devices on.
        <br /><br />
        If you have an Android Wear device, please make sure you open the app on the watch so that
        it will be able to run in the background.
